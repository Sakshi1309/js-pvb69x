Clousers: Functions bundled together along with its outer lexical scope is know as clouser. This means whenever a function is returned, even if it is vanished in execution context it still remembers the reference it was pointing to.

Callbacks: Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called callback functions. A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed. example: setTiomeOut

First-class citizens: In javascript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be returned by another function, and can be used as a property of an object.

Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function is cached based on its parameters. If the parameter of that function is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned.

Higher Order Functions: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

Immediately Invoked Function: An Immediately Invoked Function ( known as IIFE and pronounced as IIFY) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

Recursion: Recursion is a programming technique that involves using functions that call themselves repeatedly until certain conditions are met. Once the conditions are met, a recursive function will return a result.

call(): It’s a predefined method in javascript.
This method invokes a method (function) by specifying the owner object.
call() method allows an object to use the method (function) of another object.

apply(): The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only difference is that, call() method takes arguments separately whereas, apply() method takes arguments as an array.

bind(): This method returns a new function, where the value of “this” keyword will be bound to the owner object, which is provided as a parameter.
